Proxima Centauri is the closest star to our Sun, part of the Alpha Centauri triple star system.

- **Red Dwarf:** It's a small, cool, and faint red dwarf star.
- **Close to Earth:** It's just over 4 light-years away, making it our closest stellar neighbor.
- **Potentially Habitable Planet:** It hosts a potentially habitable planet called Proxima Centauri b, which is slightly larger than Earth and orbits within the star's habitable zone.
- **Flares:** Proxima Centauri is known for its frequent and powerful flares, which could make life on any orbiting planets difficult.

Proxima Centauri is a fascinating object for astronomers due to its proximity and potential for hosting life. It's a prime target for future space telescopes and exoplanet research.
